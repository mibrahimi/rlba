    This takes `Environment` and `agent` instances and coordinates their
    interaction. Agent is updated if `should_update=True`. This can be used as:

      loop = EnvironmentLoop(environment, agent)
      loop.run(num_episodes)

    A `Counter` instance can optionally be given. If not given a local Counter will be
    created to maintain counts between calls to the `run` method.

    A `Logger` instance can also be passed in order to control the output of the
    loop. If not given a platform-specific default logger will be used as defined
    by utils.loggers.make_default_logger. A string `label` can be passed to easily
    change the label associated with the default logger; this is ignored if a
    `Logger` instance is given.

    A list of 'Observer' instances can be specified to generate additional metrics
    to be logged by the logger. They have access to the 'Environment' instance,
    the current timestep datastruct and the current action.
